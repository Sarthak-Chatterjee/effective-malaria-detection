# effective-malaria-detection
This project addresses data leakage in malaria detection using CNNs by implementing a patient-wise split dataset. We trained various models, including custom CNNs, transfer learning, and ensemble models, and applied float16 and int8 quantization for optimized performance using PyTorch.
